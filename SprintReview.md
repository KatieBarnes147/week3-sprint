## üéØ Sprint Goal Review
**What was the main learning objective or goal for this assignment?**  
The goal was to learn how to create a static web page using HTML and CSS, structure it properly, apply both internal and external styles, and successfully host the project using GitLab Pages.  

**Did you achieve this goal? Why or why not?**  
Yes, I achieved this goal. I built the required layout, styled it using multiple CSS methods, and learned how to configure GitLab Pages for hosting. I also went beyond the basic requirements by adding a city input field for better usability.

## üìã What We Delivered
**What specific work did you complete this sprint?**  
I completed all ten tasks, including creating the HTML file, adding headers, weather markup, inputs, button, external link, and CSS styling, as well as hosting the project through GitLab Pages.  
Additionally, I added a **city input field** and updated the header text so the instructions matched all available input options. When I reopened my browser my website did not make any sense to me that is why I felt the need to update it. 

**What deliverables are you most proud of?**  
I‚Äôm most proud of the final layout, responsive design, the CSS animation on the header, and resolving GitLab Pages hosting. Adding the city input was a nice usability improvement.
